## 📊 Statistics & Monitoring

The system tracks:

- **Acquisition counts**: Total locks acquired per resource/type
- **Release counts**: Total locks released
- **Timeout counts**: Failed acquisitions
- **Error counts**: Exceptions during lock operations
- **Wait times**: Min/max/avg time waiting for lock
- **Hold times**: Min/max/avg time holding lock
- **Current state**: Active holders and pending waiters
- **Recent operations**: Last 100 operations per resource

Example output:
```json
{
  "episodic_db:episodic_memory.db": {
    "read": {
      "total_acquisitions": 145,
      "avg_wait_time_ms": 2.3,
      "avg_hold_time_ms": 15.7,
      "current_holders": 3
    },
    "write": {
      "total_acquisitions": 42,
      "avg_wait_time_ms": 5.1,
      "avg_hold_time_ms": 25.3,
      "current_holders": 0,
      "current_waiters": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Decorator (Simplest)
```python
@read_lock("database", timeout=10.0)
async def query_data():
    return await db.fetch()

@write_lock("database", timeout=30.0)
async def update_data(value):
    await db.update(value)
```

### Pattern 2: Context Manager (Flexible)
```python
async def process_data():
    manager = get_lock_manager()

    async with manager.read_lock("database"):
        data = await read_data()

    async with manager.write_lock("database"):
        await write_data(processed_data)
```

### Pattern 3: Distributed (Cross-Process)
```python
def save_to_file():
    manager = get_lock_manager()

    with manager.distributed_lock("shared_file"):
        with open("data.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(data, f)
```

- [x] Wrap read methods with `@read_lock` or `async with read_lock()`
- [x] Wrap write methods with `@write_lock` or `async with write_lock()`
- [x] Wrap file I/O with `distributed_lock()`
- [x] Test concurrent access
- [x] Monitor statistics
- [x] Adjust timeouts as needed
