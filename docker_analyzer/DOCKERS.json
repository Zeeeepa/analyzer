Deployment Sequence
1. Core Infrastructure First
vast-dataengine-operator: Deploy this master operator first as it orchestrates the entire serverless compute layer. This is your control plane and should be running before other components.
csi: Deploy the Container Storage Interface next to establish the "Infinite Memory" storage layer that other services will depend on.
2. Data & Query Layer
vast-db-cli: Use this to initialize and configure your VAST DataBase instances.
trino-vast: Deploy the SQL engine once storage is available, enabling query capabilities across your AI OS database.
3. Real-time Processing
insight-engine-deploy: Use this to scale and deploy your insight services for real-time data refinement and vectorization.
insight-engine: The actual engine that performs vectorization and data refinement - deployed via the deploy component above.
4. Observability & Management
vast-dataengine-collector: Deploy telemetry collection for monitoring AI workloads in real-time.
vast-admin-mcp: Deploy the Model Context Protocol administrative interface for AI agent management.
5. Supporting Tools
devopstools: Infrastructure utilities as needed.
vast-builder: Use for CI/CD pipelines and development environments.
Key Considerations
Orchestration: Since vast-dataengine-operator is described as the "Master Operator," it likely uses Kubernetes operators pattern. Ensure your K8s cluster is properly configured before deployment.
Dependencies: The CSI driver must be functional before deploying stateful workloads. The operator needs to be healthy before deploying managed services.
Configuration: Each component likely requires configuration for interconnection - especially the operator knowing about storage, the SQL engine knowing about the database, and the insight engine knowing about data sources.
