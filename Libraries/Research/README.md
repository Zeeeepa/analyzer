# Research

This directory contains reference materials and research resources for autonomous coding systems.

## Key Resources

- **[ATLAS](https://github.com/Zeeeepa/ATLAS)** - A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for ATLAS, a Neo4j-powered task management system for LLM Agents implementing a three-tier architecture (Projects, Tasks, Knowledge) to manage complex workflows with Deep Research capabilities.

- **[research-swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/research-swarm)** - A comprehensive research framework enabling multi-agent collaboration for deep analysis and information gathering.

## Integration with Analysis Modules

The **Analysis** directory contains code analysis tools (AST parsing, LSP adapters, static analysis) that examine and understand codebases. The **Research** directory provides strategic frameworks and task orchestration systems.

### Full CI/CD Autonomous Coding Pipeline

Together, these components enable a complete autonomous development workflow:

1. **Discovery** - Research frameworks identify tasks and requirements
2. **Planning** - ATLAS orchestrates multi-tier project/task/knowledge structures
3. **Analysis** - Analysis modules parse code, extract symbols, identify patterns
4. **Change Synthesis** - AI agents generate code modifications based on analysis
5. **Validation** - Static analysis and LSP integration verify correctness
6. **Deployment** - Automated commit/PR workflows deliver changes

### Capabilities Provided

- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - research-swarm enables parallel agent workflows
- **Contextual Understanding** - Deep research capabilities inform better code decisions
- **Task Management** - ATLAS provides persistent memory and dependency tracking
- **Code Intelligence** - Analysis modules supply semantic understanding of codebases
- **Autonomous Iteration** - Closed-loop systems can self-improve through research → analysis → action cycles

This architecture supports truly autonomous coding agents that can discover, plan, execute, and validate software changes with minimal human intervention.
